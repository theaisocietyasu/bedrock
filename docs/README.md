# Platform documentation

Platform is shared infrastructure for student orgs. One deployment serves many orgs. Each org is a Discord server and turns on only the modules it uses.

## Module pages

Each module has a `README.md` in its folder with its files, routes, jobs, tools and tables. The modules below also have a page here, because they need setup or have a large surface.

| Page | Module |

## Notes

- `tests/contract/routes.txt` lists every route, its methods and its view. A test fails if the file and the app do not agree.
- An org is a row in `organizations`. It maps to one Discord server (guild).
- `org_prefix` is the URL name of an org, for example `robotics`. Most routes have it in the path.
- When a page and the code do not agree, the code is correct. Change the page in the same commit.
