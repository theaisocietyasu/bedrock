# Architecture

Platform is a Flask API with a Discord bot, a job worker and an MCP server. All four use the same code in `core/` and `modules/` and the same database.

## Processes

| Process | Entry point | Port | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API | `main.py` under gunicorn | 8000 | Every HTTP route |
| Discord bot | `bot_main.py` | | Slash commands and Jeopardy, with the cogs in `modules/bot`, `modules/games` and `modules/leetcode` |
| Job worker | `worker_main.py` | | Runs jobs from the Procrastinate queue. Postgres only |
| MCP server | `mcp_main.py` | 8001 | Module tools for agents, over MCP |
| Dashboard | `dashboard/` | 5000 (5173 in dev) | The officer pages for each org and the member store (Vite, React) |

The database is Postgres in production, or SQLite for a small deployment. Alembic makes the schema.

The API does not need the bot. It reads Discord servers, roles and members over Discord's REST API with `BOT_TOKEN` (`core/integrations/discord.py`). The Jeopardy routes under `/api/bot` are the exception: they call the bot's cogs, so they work only when the bot runs in the API process (`RUN_BOT_IN_API=true`).

## Layout

```
main.py, bot_main.py, worker_main.py, mcp_main.py   the four entry points
core/          shared code: config, database, jobs, tools, secrets, audit, logs, HTTP hooks, Discord and RunPod clients, hosting providers
modules/       one folder per module, not nested; registry.py mounts the blueprints, manifest.py lists categories, models, jobs and tools
alembic/       migrations
tests/         pytest; tests/contract/ checks every route a client uses
dashboard/, site/   the dashboard and member store, the docs and landing site
deploy/        the RunPod start script and the SQLite to Postgres copy script
```

`core/` imports nothing from `modules/`. Only the route files (`api.py`, `member_api.py`), `registry.py`, `cli.py` and the route helpers in `modules/auth/` import Flask. `make ci` checks both with import-linter.

## How a request runs

1. Flask-CORS adds the CORS headers for an allowed origin. The list is in `main.py`, plus `CORS_EXTRA_ORIGINS` and `DASHBOARD_URL`.
2. If the path starts with a `DISABLED_ROUTES` prefix, the API returns 404.
3. `modules/registry.py` sends the request to the module blueprint. If the module is turned off for the org in the URL, it returns 404.
4. A decorator from `modules/auth` checks the caller. See [Authentication](./authentication.md).
5. The view reads the request, calls the module's `service.py` and returns JSON.
6. Before the response goes out, `core/http/request_log.py` logs one line, and `core/http/audit_hook.py` writes each successful change to `audit_log`.

The org comes from the URL (`org_prefix` or `org_id`), or from the machine token. The `X-Organization-*` headers that older clients send are used only in the request log.

Views get a database session from `officer_route`, `machine_route` or `member_view` in `modules/auth/routes.py`, or from `core.db.session()`. Older views call `next(db_connect.get_db())` and close the session in a `finally` block.

## Modules

A module is a folder in `modules/` with only the files it needs: `service.py` for the logic, `api.py` for the routes, `models.py`, `jobs.py` and `tools.py`. The REST routes, jobs, tools and the bot call the same `service.py` functions. [Writing a module](./writing-a-module.md) gives the rules and the places to register a module.

Orgs can turn off the optional modules: `points`, `storefront`, `calendar`, `leetcode`, `compute` and `alerts`. The list is `OPTIONAL_MODULES` in `modules/organizations/service.py`. The switches are in `Organization.config["modules"]`. A module with no entry is on, so an org made before the switch existed keeps the module. A new org gets an entry for each optional module: on for the modules in `NEW_ORG_MODULES` in `modules/manifest.py`, off for the others. Officers add and remove modules on the dashboard Modules page, or with `flask --app main org modules <prefix> --on x --off y`.

### Modules and packs

| | Module | Pack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Is | A feature with code, in `modules/<name>/` | Content or presets with no code of their own, in `packs/<name>/` |
| Examples | `knowledge`, `alerts`, `compute` | `packs/asu` (campus pages and live queries), `packs/careers` (alert feeds) |
| Per org | Optional modules are switched on or off for each org | An org adds a pack's sources or feeds in the module that uses it |
| On the dashboard | A card on the Modules page | Shown on the card of the module that uses it, and on that module's page |

`CATALOG` in `modules/manifest.py` gives each module a title, a description, what it needs (integration keys or settings) and the packs it reads. `CATEGORIES` puts each module in one category. The Core category (organizations, auth, dashboard, users, public, superadmin, bot) is always on and is not on the Modules page. `GET /api/dashboard/<org>/modules` returns the catalog with the org's switches and whether each need is connected.

## Jobs

A module declares a job in its `jobs.py` with `@job(name, cron=..., retry=...)` from `core/jobs.py`. Code starts a job with `jobs.defer(name, **kwargs)`. Each module README lists its jobs. `flask --app main jobs list` lists all of them.

- On Postgres, `defer` adds a row to the Procrastinate queue. The worker runs the job, tries it again if it fails, and runs the periodic jobs.
- On SQLite, there is no queue. `defer` runs the job in a thread of the calling process. A thread in the API runs the periodic jobs, and `worker_main.py` stops.

`JOBS_BACKEND=inline|procrastinate` sets the choice. The tests use `inline`. Each run of a job with `audit=True` (the default) is written to `audit_log`.

## Tools and the MCP server

Apps and agents read and change Platform data through tools. A module declares a tool in its `tools.py` with `@tool` from `core/tools.py`. Platform serves each tool two ways:

- Over MCP (streamable HTTP) from `mcp_main.py`, at `http://<host>:8001/mcp`.
- Over HTTP from the API: `GET /api/tools` lists the tools, and `POST /api/tools/<name>` calls one with the arguments as the JSON body.

Both need a machine token: `Authorization: Bearer plat_...`. A caller sees only the tools that its token scopes allow and that its org has turned on. An unknown tool and a refused tool both return 404, so a token cannot find tools it may not use. A tool always acts on the caller's org. It has no org argument.

A tool marked confirm changes or deletes something that is hard to undo. It runs only when the call has `confirm=true`. Without it, nothing changes and the result has `confirm_required`, the arguments, and for `apps.deploy` and `apps.rollback` the dry run. An agent shows that to a person, then calls again with `confirm=true`. Over MCP, read tools have `readOnlyHint` and confirm tools have `destructiveHint`.

No tool reads a secret value, makes or revokes a token, or changes points or the store. Officers do those in the dashboard.

Each call, allowed or refused, is a row in `audit_log` with `action=tool <name>`, `source=mcp` or `api`, and the token as the actor. A call that waits for confirm has `details.confirm=pending`. The MCP server keeps no session state, so you can run more than one. Start it with `docker compose --profile mcp up -d mcp`.
