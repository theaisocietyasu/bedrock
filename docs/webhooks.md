# Webhooks

Platform sends a message to a channel when an event happens in an org. Officers add webhooks on the dashboard page Automations, Webhooks. Each webhook has a name, a destination and the events it sends.

Each event also shows on the dashboard page Notifications, with or without a webhook. The hourly limit applies only to webhook messages.

## Events

| Key | Label | Sent by | Sent when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `errors` | Errors | `modules/dashboard/errors.py` | A new error group, or a resolved group that comes back. See [Health, logs and errors](./operations.md#health-logs-and-errors) |
| `job.failed` | Failed job runs | `core/jobs.py` | A job with an `org_id` or `org_prefix` argument fails. Jobs for the whole server do not send it |
| `pod.started` | Pods started | `modules/compute/service.py`, `schedule.py` | An officer or a tool starts or restarts a pod, or the session schedule starts it |
| `pod.stopped` | Pods stopped | `modules/compute/service.py`, `schedule.py` | An officer or a tool stops or terminates a pod, or the session schedule stops it |
| `app.deployed` | App deploys | `modules/runpod/service.py` | A deploy becomes healthy, or fails |
| `order.created` | Store orders | `modules/storefront/service.py` | A member places an order |
| `member.joined` | New members | `modules/users/service.py` | A person joins the org at sign-in, through a form or a CSV import. A Discord member sync does not send it |
| `knowledge.crawl_failed` | Knowledge crawl failures | `modules/knowledge/runs.py` | A crawl of a knowledge source fails |

The page lists an event only when its module is on for the org. Pods need `compute` and orders need `storefront`.

## Delivery

- `emit()` returns at once. A thread finds the enabled webhooks of the org that take the event and posts the message to each. A request never waits for a post.
- Each process sends at most 30 messages in an hour for each org and event. More messages in that hour are dropped.
- Each webhook keeps the time and the error of its last message. The page shows the error in red.
- "Send test" posts one message now and shows the result.
- A post has a timeout of 10 seconds and does not follow redirects. An error says the status code. It never has the URL.

## Destinations

Discord is the only kind now. A URL must match `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>` and its host must resolve to public addresses (`core/net.py`). Platform encrypts the URL with `SECRETS_KEY` and never returns it. The page shows the host and the last 4 digits of the webhook id.

To add a kind, such as Slack, add a `Kind` to `KINDS` in `core/webhooks.py`: a URL pattern, an example, a function that turns a `Message` into the body, and a hint. The page reads the kinds from the API.

## Add an event

1. Declare it at the top of the module's `service.py` (or the file that sends it):

   ```python
   from core import webhooks

   webhooks.declare("thing.done", "Things done", "A thing ends.", "things")
   ```

   The last argument is the optional module that must be on for the org.
2. Send it where the event happens, after the commit:

   ```python
   webhooks.emit(org_id, "thing.done", webhooks.Message(title=f"Thing {name} done", color=webhooks.GREEN))
   ```

   `emit()` takes an org id or an org prefix. It never raises.
3. Add the event to the table on this page and to `webhookEvents` in `dashboard/scripts/fixtures.mjs`.
4. Add a test in `tests/contract/test_webhooks.py`. The `sent` fixture sends in the test thread and keeps each post.

## Routes

All routes are under `/api/dashboard/<org>/webhooks`, for officers of the org.

| Route | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | The webhooks, the events and kinds to pick from, the alert feeds when `alerts` is on, and `secrets_key` |
| `POST /` | Adds a webhook: `{"name", "kind": "discord", "url", "events": [...]}`. Returns 201 |
| `PUT /<id>` | Changes `name`, `url`, `events` or `enabled`. A missing key keeps its value |
| `DELETE /<id>` | Removes the webhook |
| `POST /<id>/test` | Posts a test message. Returns `{"ok", "message"}` |

## Alert feeds and the server webhook

- Alert feeds post job and hackathon listings to their own webhooks. Set them on the Alerts page. See [Alerts](./modules/alerts.md). The Webhooks page lists the feeds and links to Alerts.
- `ERROR_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` gets every new error of every org and of the server. It is not an org webhook and does not show on the page.

The `webhooks` table is in [Data model](./data-model.md). Migration `a1358e0da9ef` moved each org secret `error_webhook_url` to a webhook named Errors that sends `errors`.
