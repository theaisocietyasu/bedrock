# Accounts

Members connect their Canvas, Google Calendar and Outlook accounts one time, and agents use them for the member. Platform keeps the OAuth grants, encrypted with `SECRETS_KEY`, and refreshes the access tokens. Agents keep no provider tokens.

## Sign-in

1. The agent calls `POST /api/accounts/members/<discord_id>/<provider>/login` and sends the returned `url` to the member in a private message. The link works one time, for 10 minutes.
2. The link signs the browser in to Discord. The sign-in continues only if that Discord account is the member that the link is for. Thus a forwarded link cannot connect a different account.
3. The browser goes to the provider's consent page, then back to `/api/accounts/<provider>/callback` in the same browser session. Platform gets the grant and keeps it.

## Routes

Agent routes are under `/api/accounts/members/<discord_id>` and need a machine token. The org is the org of the token.

| Route | Scope | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /` | `accounts:link` | Connected providers, scopes and expiry. No tokens |
| `POST /<provider>/login` | `accounts:link` | Starts a sign-in. Returns `url` and `expires_at` |
| `DELETE /<provider>` | `accounts:link` | Removes the grant |
| `GET /<provider>/token` | `accounts:token` | `access_token`, `scopes`, `expires_at`. Refreshes the token if it expires in less than one minute. Writes to the audit log |

`token` returns these errors:

- 404: the member has no connection.
- 409: the member must connect again. The grant has no refresh token, or the provider revoked it. In that case Platform deletes the grant.
- 502: the provider does not answer.
- 503: `SECRETS_KEY` is not set or cannot decrypt the grant.

Other routes:

- `GET /api/accounts/providers`: the providers that are on.
- `GET /api/accounts/<org>/me` and `DELETE /api/accounts/<org>/me/<provider>`: a member signed in with Discord lists and removes their own connections.

## Canvas tools

Agents with the `canvas:read` scope read a member's own Canvas through six read-only tools. Each tool takes `discord_id`, the member. It uses only that member's Canvas grant in the org of the token. The tools show only when the Canvas provider is on.

| Tool | Returns | Canvas route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canvas.courses` | Active courses: `id`, `name`, `code` | `GET /api/v1/courses?enrollment_state=active` |
| `canvas.assignments` | Assignments to submit, soonest due first: `name`, `course`, `due_at`, `points`, `url` | `GET /api/v1/users/self/todo` |
| `canvas.grades` | Current grade in each active course: `course`, `score`, `grade` | `GET /api/v1/courses?include[]=total_scores` |
| `canvas.announcements` | Recent announcements in active courses: `title`, `course`, `posted_at`, `body` (240 characters, no HTML), `url` | `GET /api/v1/announcements` |
| `canvas.calendar` | Upcoming events: `title`, `start_at`, `location`, `url` | `GET /api/v1/users/self/upcoming_events` |
| `canvas.assignment_grades` | Each graded assignment: `course`, `name`, `score`, `points`, `grade` | `GET /api/v1/courses/<id>/assignments?include[]=submission` |

- Each result also has `text`, a short summary for the agent. A result has 20 items or fewer. A list reads 5 pages or fewer, and follows the `Link` header only to the same Canvas.
- The results are private to the member. The agent must show them only to that member, for example in a direct message. Platform does not log them, add them to knowledge or write them to the audit log. The audit log gets only the tool name.
- If the token expires in less than one minute, Platform refreshes it first, as the `token` route does.
- Errors: 409 when the member has not connected Canvas, the connection expired, or Canvas rejected the token. The message tells the agent to start a login with `POST /api/accounts/members/<discord_id>/canvas/login`. 502 when Canvas or the refresh does not answer.

## Settings

| Variable | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `ACCOUNTS_BASE_URL` | The public URL of the API. Required, because providers send the browser back to it |
| `ACCOUNTS_<NAME>_CLIENT_ID`, `ACCOUNTS_<NAME>_CLIENT_SECRET` | Turn on a provider. Names: `GOOGLE`, `CANVAS`, `MICROSOFT` |
| `ACCOUNTS_CANVAS_URL` | The school's Canvas, like `https://canvas.example.edu`. If it is not set, Platform uses the `canvas_url` of the one pack that sets it, such as `https://canvas.asu.edu` from the ASU pack |
| `ACCOUNTS_<NAME>_SCOPES` | Space-separated. Defaults: Google calendar events read, all that the Canvas key allows, Microsoft calendar and mail read |
| `ACCOUNTS_<NAME>_AUTHORIZE_URL`, `ACCOUNTS_<NAME>_TOKEN_URL` | Other provider URLs. Microsoft defaults to the common tenant |

Add these redirect URLs:

- In the Discord app of `CLIENT_ID`: `<ACCOUNTS_BASE_URL>/api/accounts/discord/callback`.
- In each provider app: `<ACCOUNTS_BASE_URL>/api/accounts/<provider>/callback`.

The provider apps are for the whole deployment. An org at a different school with its own Canvas needs settings for each org, which can come from org secrets later.

The `accounts.prune` job runs each hour and deletes expired sign-ins.
