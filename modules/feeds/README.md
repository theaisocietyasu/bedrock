# alerts

Posts new job listings and upcoming hackathons to an org's Discord channels through webhooks. Each feed reads one source on a schedule and posts only new items. Other org events go through `core/webhooks.py`; the Webhooks page lists the feeds.

## Surface

- Routes: `/api/alerts/<org>/feeds` and `/api/alerts/<org>/presets`, behind the `alerts` switch. Officers of the org only. `GET /feeds/<key>/history` returns the runs and items of a feed. `GET /presets` returns the feeds that packs offer.
- Jobs: `alerts.run_due`, schedule `*/15 * * * *`; `alerts.run_feed`, started by the run route.
- Tools: `alerts.list`, `alerts.presets`, `alerts.history`, `alerts.save`, `alerts.run`, `alerts.delete` (confirm), all with scope `alerts:manage`. Tools marked confirm run only with `confirm=true`.
- Tables: `alert_feeds`, `alert_posts`, `alert_runs`. Secrets: `alert_webhook_<feed key>`.
