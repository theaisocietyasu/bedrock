# Modules

One folder for each module. Each folder has a `README.md` with its files and its surface: routes, jobs, tools and tables. [docs/writing-a-module.md](../docs/writing-a-module.md) gives the rules and the places to register a new module.

The folders are not nested. `CATEGORIES` in `manifest.py` groups the modules below in the same sections as the Explore page of the dashboard. Each module is in one category, and a module can have sub-modules: content in `submodules/` that the module reads. `CATALOG` in `manifest.py` gives the title, description, needs and sub-modules that the page shows for each module. A new org starts with every module in the Org switch column off.

## Core

Core modules are always on. The Explore page of the dashboard does not show them.

## Webhooks

## Compute

| Module | Does | Org switch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [godfather](godfather/README.md) | Pods on a hosting provider (RunPod) that members connect to with the Godfather CLI | `godfather` |
| [runpod](runpod/README.md) | App deploys to a hosting provider (RunPod). The dashboard calls it Hosting | `runpod` |

## Shared files

`registry.py` mounts each blueprint. `manifest.py` lists the categories and the model, job and tool modules. `cli.py` has the `flask --app main org`, `jobs` and `config` commands. `tests/test_module_layout.py` checks that each module is in these lists and in the docs.

The modules from SoDA (points, storefront, users, superadmin, calendar, organizations, public, auth, games) do not follow the module pattern in full. Each README lists its Known gaps.
