"""Canvas tools for agents: one member's courses, assignments, grades, announcements and calendar. No Flask here.

Each tool reads Canvas with the Canvas grant of the member named by discord_id, in the caller's org, and no
other grant. The tools show only when the deployment has the Canvas provider on. They are read-only. Their
results go back to the caller only and are never added to knowledge or written to the logs.
